        <h1>Welcome to My Secure AWS Static Website!</h1>
        <p>This website is hosted securely on **Amazon S3** and delivered globally via **AWS CloudFront**.</p>
        <p>A key security feature demonstrated here is **Origin Access Control (OAC)**, ensuring the S3 bucket remains private and only CloudFront can retrieve its content.</p>
        <p>The entire project is managed with **Git** for version control and publicly showcased on **GitHub**, demonstrating my proficiency in modern development workflows and cloud infrastructure.</p>
        <p>I'm excited to explore more AWS services and build scalable, secure applications.</p>
