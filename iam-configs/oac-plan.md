"## CloudFront OAC Plan" 
"" 
"This document outlines the strategy for securing the S3 static website using CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC) instead of direct S3 bucket policies." 
"" 
"### IAM Policies for S3 Access (Post-OAC)" 
"" 
"- **s3:GetObject:** Required for CloudFront to retrieve objects from the S3 bucket." 
"- **s3:ListBucket:** Potentially needed for CloudFront if specific configurations require listing bucket contents (less common for static sites)." 
"" 
"The S3 bucket policy will be updated to allow access *only* from the CloudFront OAC identity."
